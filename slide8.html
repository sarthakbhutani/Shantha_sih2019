               5 Technologies Now Changing Manufacturing
These technologies are having a disruptive impact on the factories of the future
As new technologies start to pervade all areas of our lives, we are beginning to see their application in the manufacturing industry. The German government coined the term ‘Industry 4.0’ which refers to this revolution of manufacturing through technology. While there is certainly some debate around the use of this term – the integration of production methods with the latest developments in computers certainly has the potential to make manufacturing autonomous, cheaper and more efficient. There are lots of ways this could be done, so what can we expect to see in the factory of the future?
1) Ultrafast 3D printing
Up until now, 3D printing has had limited applications in the manufacture of plastics. Making plastic layer by layer is a time consuming and expensive process compared to traditional techniques like injection moulding. However, Neil Hopkinson of the University of Sheffield has been working on a 3D printing technique which will make it economically viable to mass print plastic objects on a huge scale.
